## Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to use the terraform-aws-vpn module:

```hcl
module "client_vpn" {
  source              = "./path/to/module"
  vpn_name            = "MyClientVPN"
  client_cidrs       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  # additional parameters...
}
```

Make sure to replace the `./path/to/module` with the actual path of the module in your project.

## Examples

Explore the following examples to understand the various use cases of the module:

1. **Client VPN Example**

   Create a Client VPN endpoint with basic settings.

   ```hcl
   module "client_vpn" {
     source        = "path/to/client-vpn"
     vpn_name      = "MyClientVPN"
     client_cidrs  = ["10.0.0.0/22"]
     # more configuration...
   }
   ```

2. **Site-to-Site VPN Example**

   Establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection between two networks.

   ```hcl
   module "site_to_site_vpn" {
     source               = "path/to/site-to-site-vpn"
     vpn_gateway_id       = "vgw-123456"
     customer_gateway_id  = "cgw-654321"
     # more configuration...
   }
   ```

## Deployment

Once you have configured your settings, deploy your VPN by running:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Confirm the action when prompted. This will create the VPN resources defined in your configuration.
